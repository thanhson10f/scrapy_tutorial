{"text": "Over the last 150 years, large stretches of salmon habitat have been eliminated by human activity:mining, livestock grazing, timber harvesting, and agriculture as well as recreational and urban development. The numerical effect is obvious: there are fewer salmon in degraded regions than in pristine ones; however, habitat loss also has the potential to reduce genetic diversity. This is most evident in cases where it results in the extinction of entire salmon populations. Indeed, most analysts believe that some kind of environmental degradation underlies the demise of many extinct salmon populations. Although some rivers have been recolonized, the unique genes of the original populations have been lost.<br><br>Large-scale disturbances in one locale also have the potential to alter the genetic structure of populations in neighboring areas, even if those areas have pristine habitats. Why? Although the homing instinct of salmon to their natal stream is strong, a fraction of the fish returning from the sea (rarely more than 15 percent) stray and spawn in nearby streams. Low levels of straying are crucial, since the process provides a source of novel genes and a mechanism by which a location can be repopulated should the fish there disappear. Yet high rates of straying can be problematic because misdirected fish may interbreed with the existing stock to such a degree that any local adaptations that are present become diluted. Straying rates remain relatively low when environmental conditions are stable, but can increase dramatically when streams suffer severe disturbance.

{"text": "According to a theory advanced by researcher Paul Martin, the wave of species extinctions that occurredin North America about 11,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene era, can be directly attributed to the arrival of humans, i.e., the Paleoindians, who were ancestors of modern Native Americans. However, anthropologist Shepard Krech points out that large animal species vanished even in areas where there is no evidence to demonstrate that Paleoindians hunted them. Nor were extinctions confined to large animals: small animals, plants, and insects disappeared, presumably not all through human consumption. Krech also contradicts Martin's exclusion of climatic change as an explanation by asserting that widespread climatic change did indeed occur at the end of the Pleistocene. Still, Krech attributes secondary if not primary responsibility for the extinctions to the Paleoindians, arguing that humans have produced local extinctions elsewhere. But, according to historian Richard White, even the attribution of secondary responsibility may not be supported by the evidence. White observes that Martin's thesis depends on coinciding dates for the arrival of humans and the decline of large animal species, and Krech, though aware that the dates are controversial, does not challenge them; yet recent archaeological discoveries are providing evidence that the date of human arrival was much earlier than 11,000 years ago.", "choice_question": "The passage mentions the extinction of species other than large animals (see highlighted text) most probably in order to", "subid": 5, "qid": "cd7ryk", "answer": "D", "options": [["A", "suggest that the Paleoindians were responsible for more extinctions than Martin's theory assumes"], ["B", "provide support for the speculation that humans arrived in North America significantly earlier than the end of the Pleistocene era"], ["C", "point out the only area in which Martin, Krech, and White agree concerning the circumstances of the Pleistocene extinctions"], ["D", "cite additional evidence tending to support Krech’s conclusions about the role of humans in the Pleistocene extinctions"], ["E", "raise a question about the logical consistency of Krech's view of Martin ’s theory"]], "enid": "e2gwvk"}

Unfortunately, because this approach fails to deal with the underlying causes of inflation, wage and price controls eventually collapse, the hitherto-repressed inflation resurfaces, and in the meantime, though the policy-makers succeed in avoiding a recession, a frozen structure of relative prices imposes distortions that do damage to the economy's prospects for long-term growth.", "choice_question": "The passage suggests that the high inflation in the United States and many European countries in the 1980's differed from inflation elsewhere in which of the following ways?", "subid": 1, "qid": "727thk", "answer": "E", "options": [["A", "It fit the rational expectations theory of inflation but not the inertia theory of inflation."], ["B", "It was possible to control without causing a recession."], ["C", "It was easier to control in those countries by applying tight monetary and fiscal policies than it would have been elsewhere."], ["D", "It was not caused by workers' and employers' expectations."], ["E", "It would not necessarily be considered high elsewhere."]], "enid": "e01nnk"}

{"text": "A small number of the forest species of lepidoptera (moths and butterflies, which exist as caterpillars during most of their life cycle) exhibit regularly recurring patterns of population growth and decline—such fluctuations in population are known as population cycles. Although many different variables influence population levels, a regular pattern such as a population cycle seems to imply a dominant, driving force. Identification of that driving force, however, has proved surprisingly elusive despite considerable research. The common approach of studying causes of population cycles by measuring the mortality caused by different agents, such as predatory birds or parasites, has been unproductive in the case of lepidoptera. Moreover, population ecologists' attempts to alter cycles by changing the caterpillars' habitat and by reducing caterpillar populations have not succeeded. In short, the evidence implies that these insect populations, if not self-regulating, may at least be regulated by an agent more intimately connected with the insect than are predatory birds or parasites.<br><br>Recent work suggests that this agent may be a virus.For many years, viral disease had been reported in declining populations of caterpillars, but population ecologists had usually considered viral disease to have contributed to the decline once it was underway rather than to have initiated it. The recent work has been made possible by new techniques of molecular biology that allow viral DNA to be detected at low concentrations in the environment. Nuclear polyhedrosis viruses are hypothesized to be the driving force behind population cycles in lepidoptera in part because the viruses themselves follow an infectious cycle in which, if protected from direct sun light, they may remain virulent for many years in the environment, embedded in durable crystals of polyhedrin protein. Once ingested by a caterpillar, the crystals dissolve, releasing the virus to infect the insect's cells. Late in the course of the infection, millions of new virus particles are formed and enclosed in polyhedron crystals. These crystals reenter the environment after the insect dies and decomposes, thus becoming available to infect other caterpillars.<br><br>One of the attractions of this hypothesis is its broad applicability. Remarkably, despite significant differences in habitat and behavior, many species of lepidoptera have population cycles of similar length, between eight and eleven years. Nuclear polyhedrosis viral infection is one factor these disparate species share.\"", "choice_question": "According to the passage, before the discovery of new techniques for detecting viral DNA, population ecologists believed that viral diseases", "subid": 4, "qid": "2agp3k", "answer": "D", "options": [["A", "were not widely prevalent among insect populations generally"], ["B", "affected only the caterpillar life stage of lepidoptera"], ["C", "were the driving force behind lepidoptera population cycles"], ["D", "attacked already declining caterpillar populations"], ["E", "infected birds and parasites that prey on various species of lepidoptera"]], "enid": "84gp7k"}

But equally important to Hopi cultural persistence may have been an inherent flexibility in their social system that may have allowed preservation of traditions even as the Hopis accommodated themselves to change. For example, the system of matrilineal clans was maintained throughout this period, even though some clans merged to form larger groups while others divided into smaller descent groups.

In reality, however, decisions are shaped not only by a manager's own values, but also by those of the corporate culture and of organizational superiors. A recent study found that managers' most stressful decisions involved \"value contention\" (conflicts among any of these sets of values). Furthermore, different types of organizational value systems were associated with different frequencies of contending values as well as with different types of managerial response. Explicit corporate values, for example, produced a greater percentage of decisions that were stressful due to value contention. Hidden values (those that an organization practices but does not acknowledge or which a superior furtively pursues in opposition to the values of the organization) produced a lower level of value contention. Although explicit values created more value contention, they were nonetheless more likely to produce flexible, well-reasoned decisions. Conversely, managers perplexed by hidden values reported feeling unable to identify an appropriate range of options.", "choice_question": "The passage suggests that which of the following has resulted from the influence of the rational model (line 8) ?", "subid": 1, "qid": "727tfk", "answer": "A", "options": [["A", "It has deflected researchers' attention from a critical factor affecting managerial decision-making."], ["B", "It has focused decision-making procedures on managers' presumed ability to prioritize key corporate values."], ["C", "It has diverted attention from the need for orientation of nonsupervisory employees to organizational values."], ["D", "It has hampered communication between academic researchers and mangers of organizations."], ["E", "It has produced theories that are practicable for analyzing decision-making processes only in relatively large organizations."]], "enid": "c61ngk"}

{"text": "Carotenoids, a family of natural pigments, form an important art of the colorful signals used by many animals.

Studies of several animal species have shown that when choosing mates, females prefer males with brighter carotenoid-based coloration.

The <span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">conventional view</span> is that carotenoids are meaningful because they are rare: healthier males can forage for more of the pigments than can their inferior counterparts.

It may be that males can use scarce carotenoids either for immune defense and detoxification or for attracting females.

But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).", "choice_question": "The passage mentions which of the following as a factor that affects the role of P. ochraceus as a keystone species within different habitats?", "subid": 2, "qid": "2b7vyk", "answer": "A", "options": [["A", "The degree to which the habitat is sheltered from waves"], ["B", "The degree to which other animals within a habitat prey on mussels"], ["C", "The fact that mussel populations are often not dominant within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus"], ["D", "The size of the P. ochraceus population within the habitat"], ["E", "The fact that there is great species diversity within some habitats occupied by P. ochraceus"]], "enid": "6c35pk"}
{"text": "Historical documents have revealed that among the Timucua, a Native American people of Florida, the best from the hunt or the harvest was given to families of high social status, even in times of economic stress. Archaeological research suggests a similar relationship between social status and diet in the Dallas communities of eastern Tennessee, prehistoric Native American groups with a social organization and economy similar to that of the Timucua. The first real clue came when archaeologists discovered that skeletons of higher-status individuals tended to be several centimeters taller than those of people of lower states.<br><br>In the largest Dallas communities, some individuals were buried in the earthen mounds that served as sub-structures for buildings important to civic and religious affairs. These burials included quantities of finely carried items made of nonlocal material, denoting the high political standing of those interred. Burials of lower-status individuals contained primarily utilitarian items such as cooking vessels and chipped stone tools and are located in more remote sections of the settlements. The burials actually formed a pattern, the tallest skeletons being found in the mounds, and the heights declining as burials became more distant from the mounds. <span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">While it is possible that taller people were simply more successful in achieving high social standing</span>, it is more likely that a number of stresses, including those resulting from a relatively poor diet, which could affect stature, were common among the lower-status groups. Excavations indicate that where food categories made up the bulk of the population’s diet: agricultural crops cultivated in the fertile alluvial soils where the communities were located, game, and wild edible plants, primarily nuts. Information about dietary variation among community members is derived by analyzing trace elements in human bone. Higher than normal levels of manganese, strontium, and vanadium probably indicate a less nutritious diet heavily dependent on edible plants. Very low concentrations of vanadium, which is scarce in meats and somewhat lower in nuts than in other plant resources, are good evidence of meat consumption and thus a better balanced-diet.

But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).", "choice_question": "The primary purpose of the passage is to", "subid": 1, "qid": "2b7vyk", "answer": "E", "options": [["A", "Point out some of the differences between dominant and keystone species."], ["B", "Emphasize the complexity of the interactions that occur between two particular species"], ["C", "detail the effect of a particular habitat on the role occupied by a certain keystone species"], ["D", "illustrate the importance of community diversity for the perpetuation of an ecosystem"], ["E", "explain some considerations involved in determining whether a species occupies a keystone role"]], "enid": "6d3eck"}

{"text": "Customer loyalty programs are attempts to bond customers to a company and its products and services by offering incentives—such as airline frequent flyer programs or special credit cards with valuable benefits—to loyal customers. In support of loyalty programs, companies often invoke the \"80/20\" principle, which states that about 80 percent of revenue typically comes from only about 20 percent of customers. However, this profitable 20 percent are not necessarily loyal buyers, especially in the sense of exclusive loyalty. Studies have demonstrated that only about 10 percent of buyers for many types of frequently purchased consumer goods are 100 percent loyal to a particular brand over a one-year period. Moreover, 100-percent-loyal buyers tend to be light buyers of the product or service. \"Divided loyalty\" better describes actual consumer behavior, since customers typically vary the brands they buy. The reasons for this behavior are fairly straightforward: people buy different brands for different occasions or for variety, or a brand may be the only one in stock or may offer better value because of a special deal. Most buyers who change brands are not lost forever; usually, they are heavy consumers who simply prefer to buy a number of brands. Such multibrand loyalty means that one company's most profitable customers will probably be its competitors' most profitable customers as well.<br><br>Still, advocates of loyalty programs contend that such programs are beneficial because the costs of serving highly loyal customers are lower, and because such loyal customers are less price sensitive than other customers. It is true that when there are start-up costs, such as credit checks, involved in serving a new customer, the costs exceed those of serving a repeat customer. However, it is not at all clear why the costs of serving a highly loyal customer should in principle be different from those of serving any other type of repeat customer. The key variables driving cost are size and type of order, special versus standard order, and so on, not high-loyalty versus divided-loyalty customers.

{"text": "Many managers are influenced by dangerous myths about pay that lead to counterproductive decisions abouthow their companies compensate employees. One such myth is that labor rates, the rate per hour paid to workers, are identical with labor costs, the money spent on labor in relation to the productivity of the labor force. This myth leads to the assumption that a company can simply lower its labor osts by cutting wages. But labor costs and labor rates are not in fact the same: one company could pay its workers considerably more than another and yet have lower labor costs if that company's productivity were higher due to the talent of its workforce, the efficiency of its work processes, or other factors. The confusion of costs with rates persists partly because labor rates are a convenient target for managers who want to make an impact on their com- pany's budgets. Because labor rates are highly visible, managers can easily compare their company's rates with those of competitors. Furthermore, labor rates often appear to be a company's most malleable financial variable: cutting wages appears an easier way to control costs than such options as reconfiguring work processes or altering product design.<br><br>The myth that labor rates and labor costs are equivalent is supported by business journalists, who frequently confound the two. For example, prominent business journals often remark on the \"high\" cost of German labor, citing as evidence the average amount paid to German workers. The myth is also perpetuated by the compensation-consulting industry, which has its own incentives to keep such myths alive. First, although some of these consulting firms have recently broadened their practices beyond the area of compensation, their mainstay con- tinues to be advising companies on changing their compensation practices. Suggesting that a company's performance can be improved in some other way than by altering its pay system may be empirically correct but contrary to the consultants' interests. Furthermore, changes to the compensation system may appear to be simpler to implement than changes to other aspects of an organization, so managers are more likely to find such advice from consultants palatable.

{"text": "Many managers are influenced by dangerous myths about pay that lead to counterproductive decisions abouthow their companies compensate employees. One such myth is that labor rates, the rate per hour paid to workers, are identical with labor costs, the money spent on labor in relation to the productivity of the labor force. This myth leads to the assumption that a company can simply lower its labor osts by cutting wages. But labor costs and labor rates are not in fact the same: one company could pay its workers considerably more than another and yet have lower labor costs if that company's productivity were higher due to the talent of its workforce, the efficiency of its work processes, or other factors. The confusion of costs with rates persists partly because labor rates are a convenient target for managers who want to make an impact on their com- pany's budgets. Because labor rates are highly visible, managers can easily compare their company's rates with those of competitors. Furthermore, labor rates often appear to be a company's most malleable financial variable: cutting wages appears an easier way to control costs than such options as reconfiguring work processes or altering product design.<br><br>The myth that labor rates and labor costs are equivalent is supported by business journalists, who frequently confound the two. For example, prominent business journals often remark on the \"high\" cost of German labor, citing as evidence the average amount paid to German workers. The myth is also perpetuated by the compensation-consulting industry, which has its own incentives to keep such myths alive. First, although some of these consulting firms have recently broadened their practices beyond the area of compensation, their mainstay con- tinues to be advising companies on changing their compensation practices. Suggesting that a company's performance can be improved in some other way than by altering its pay system may be empirically correct but contrary to the consultants' interests. Furthermore, changes to the compensation system may appear to be simpler to implement than changes to other aspects of an organization, so managers are more likely to find such advice from consultants palatable. Finally, to the extant that changes in compensation create new problems, the consultants will continue to have work solving the problems that result from their advice.", "choice_question": "The author of the passage suggests which of the following about the advice that the consulting firms discussed in the passage customarily give to companies attempting to control costs?", "subid": 1, "qid": "a77sbk", "answer": "A", "options": [["A", "It often fails to bring about the intended changes in companies' compensation systems."], ["B", "It has highly influenced views that predominate in prominent business journals."], ["C", "It tends to result in decreased labor rates but increased labor costs."], ["D", "It leads to changes in companies' compensation practices that are less visible than changes to work processes would be."], ["E", "It might be different if the consulting firms were less narrowly specialized."]], "enid": "991jmk"}

{"text": "Findings from several studies on corporate mergers and acquisitions during the 1970's and 1980's raise questions about why firms initiate and consummate such transactions. One study showed, for example, that acquiring firms were on average unable to maintain acquired firms' pre-merger levels of profitability. A second study concluded that post-acquisition gains to most acquiring firms were not adequate to cover the premiums paid to obtain acquired firms. A third demonstrated that, following the announcement of a prospective merger, the stock of the prospective acquiring firm tends to increase in value much less than does that of the firm for which it bids. Yet mergers and acquisitions remain common, and bidders continue to assert that their objectives are economic ones. Acquisitions may well have the desirable effect of channeling a nation's resources efficiently from less to more efficient sectors of its economy, but the individual acquisitions executives arranging these deals must see them as advancing either their own or their companies' private economic interests.

{"text": "Many economists believe that a high rate of business savings in the United States is a necessary precursorto investment, because business sav- ings, as opposed to personal savings, comprise almost three-quarters of the national savings rate, and the national savings rate heavily influences the overall rate of business investment. These economists further postulate that real interest rates—the difference between the rates charged by lenders and the inflation rates—will be low when national savings exceed business investment (creating a savings surplus), and high when national savings fall below the level of business investment (creating a savings deficit ). However, during the 1960's real interest rates were often higher when the national savings surplus was large. Counter-intuitive behavior also occurred when real interest rates skyrocketed from 2 percent in 1980 to 7 percent in 1982, even though national savings and investments were roughly equal throughout the period. Clearly, real interest rates respond to influences other than the savings/investment nexus. Indeed, real interest rates may themselves influence swings in the savings and investment rates. As real interest rates shot up after 1979, foreign investors poured capital into the United States, the price of domestic goods increased prohibitively abroad, and the price of foreign-made goods became lower in the United States.

{"text": "Prior to 1965 geologists assumed that the two giant rock plates meeting at the San Andreas Fault generate heat through friction as they grind past eachother, but in 1965 Henyey found that temperatures in drill holes near the fault were not as elevated as had been expected. Some geologists wondered whether the absence of friction-generated heat could be explained by the kinds of rock composing the fault. Geologists' pre-1965 assumptions concerning heat generated in the fault were based on calculations about common varieties of rocks, such as limestone and granite; but \"weaker\" materials, such as clays, had already been identified in samples retrieved from the fault zone. Under normal conditions, rocks composed of clay produce far less friction than do other rock types.<br><br>In 1992 Byerlee tested whether these materials would produce friction 10 to 15 kilometers below the Earth's surface. Byerlee found that when clay samples were subjected to the thousands of atmospheres of pressure they would encounter deep inside the Earth, they produced as much friction as was produced by other rock types. The harder rocks push against each other, the hotter they become; in other words, pressure itself, not only the rocks' properties, affects frictional heating. Geologists therefore wondered whether the friction between the plates was being reduced by pockets of pressurized water within the fault that push the plates away from each other.", "choice_question": "The passage suggests which of the following regarding Henyey's findings about temperature in the San Andreas Fault?", "subid": 1, "qid": "527rmk", "answer": "A", "options": [["A", "Scientists have yet to formulate a definitive explanation for Henyey's findings."], ["B", "Recent research suggests that Henyey's explanation for the findings should be modified."], ["C", "Henyey's findings had to be recalculated in light of Byerlee's 1992 experiment."], ["D", "Henyey's findings provided support for an assumption long held by geologists."], ["E", "Scientists have been unable to duplicate Henyey's findings using more recent experimental methods."]], "enid": "271hek"}

Global expansion through acquisition is usually expensive, and expansion through internal growth is time-consuming and sometimes impossible in markets that are not actively growing. Some service industry companies, in fact, regard these traditional routes to global expansion as inappropriate for service industries because of their special need to preserve local responsiveness through local presence and expertise. One travel agency has eschewed the traditional route altogether. A survivor of the changes that swept the travel industry as a result of the deregulation of the airlines in 1978 — changes that included dramatic growth in the corporate demand for travel services, as well as extensive restructuring and consolidation within the travel industry - this agency adopted a unique structure for globalization. Rather than expand by attempting to develop its own offices abroad, which would require the devel- opment of local travel management expertise sufficient to capture foreign markets, the company solved its globalization dilemma effectively by forging alliances with the best foreign partners it could find.

{"text": "According to a theory advanced by researcher Paul Martin, the wave of species extinctions that occurredin North America about 11,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene era, can be directly attributed to the arrival of humans, i.e., the Paleoindians, who were ancestors of modern Native Americans. However, anthropologist Shepard Krech points out that large animal species vanished even in areas where there is no evidence to demonstrate that Paleoindians hunted them. Nor were extinctions confined to large animals: small animals, plants, and insects disappeared, presumably not all through human consumption. Krech also contradicts Martin's exclusion of climatic change as an explanation by asserting that widespread climatic change did indeed occur at the end of the Pleistocene. Still, Krech attributes secondary if not primary responsibility for the extinctions to the Paleoindians, arguing that humans have produced local extinctions elsewhere. But, according to historian Richard White, even the attribution of secondary responsibility may not be supported by the evidence. White observes that Martin's thesis depends on coinciding dates for the arrival of humans and the decline of large animal species, and Krech, though aware that the dates are controversial, does not challenge them; yet recent archaeological discoveries are providing evidence that the date of human arrival was much earlier than 11,000 years ago.", "choice_question": "The passage suggests that Krech would be most likely to agree with a theory of the Pleistocene species extinctions that", "subid": 4, "qid": "cd7ryk", "answer": "A", "options": [["A", "included climate change as one of the causes of the extinctions"], ["B", "incorporated a revised date for human arrival in North America"], ["C", "eliminated the Paleoindians as a factor in the extinctions"], ["D", "identified a single cause for the extinctions"], ["E", "emphasized the role of hunting in causing most species extinctions"]], "enid": "91gwuk"}

{"text": "The sloth bear, an insect-eating animal native to Nepal, exhibits only one behavior that is truly distinct from that ofother bear species: the females carry their cubs (at least part-time) until the cubs are about nine months old, even though the cubs can walk on their own at six months. Cub-carrying also occurs among some other myrmecophagous (ant-eating) mammals; therefore, one explanation is that cub-carrying is necessitated by myrmecophagy, since myrmecophagy entails a low metabolic rate and high energy expenditure in walking between food patches. However, although polar bears' locomotion is similarly inefficient, polar bear cubs walk along with their mother. Furthermore, the daily movements of sloth bears and American black bears - which are similar in size to sloth bears and have similar-sized home ranges - reveal similar travel rates and distances, suggesting that if black bear cubs are able to keep up with their mother, so too should sloth bear cubs.<br><br>An alternative explanation is defense from predation. Black bear cubs use trees for defense, whereas brown bears and polar bears, which regularly inhabit treeless environments, rely on aggression to protect their cubs. Like brown bears and polar bears (and unlike other myrmecophagous mammals, which are noted for their passivity), sloth bears are easily provoked to aggression. Sloth bears also have relatively large canine teeth, which appear to be more functional for fighting than for foraging. Like brown bears and polar bears, sloth bears may have evolved in an environment with few trees. They are especially attracted to food-rich grasslands; although few grasslands persist today on the Indian subcontinent, this type of habitat was once wide-spread there. Grasslands support high densities of tigers, which fight and sometimes kill sloth bears; sloth bears also coexist with and have been killed by tree-climbing leopards, and are often confronted and chased by rhinoceroses and elephants, which can topple trees. Collectively these factors probably selected against tree-climbing as a defensive strategy for sloth bear cubs. Because sloth bears are smaller than brown and polar bears and are under greater threat from dangerous animals, they may have adopted the extra precaution of carrying their cubs. Although cub-carrying may also be adoptive for myrmecophagous foraging, the behavior of sloth bear cubs, which climb on their mother's back at the first sign of danger, suggests that predation was a key stimulus.", "choice_question": "The primary purpose of the passage is to", "subid": 1, "qid": "be7rzk", "answer": "B", "options": [["A", "trace the development of a particular behavioral characteristic of the sloth bear"], ["B", "explore possible explanations for a particular behavioral characteristic of the sloth bear"], ["C", "compare the defensive strategies of sloth bear cubs to the defensive strategies of cubs of other bear species"], ["D", "describe how certain behavioral characteristics of the sloth bear differ from those of other myrmecophagous mammals"], ["E", "provide an alternative to a generally accepted explanation of a particular behavioral characteristic of myrmecophagous mammals"]], "enid": "471iek"}

{"text": "Jon Clark’s study of the effect of the modernization of a telephone exchange on exchange maintenance work and workers is a solid contribution to a debate that encompasses two lively issues in the history and sociology of technology: technological determinism and social constructivism.<br><br>Clark makes the point that the characteristics of a technology have a decisive influence on job skills and work organization. Put more strongly, technology can be a primary determinant of social and managerial organization. Clark believes this possibility has been obscured by the recent sociological fashion, exemplified by Braverman’s analysis, that emphasizes the way machinery reflects social choices. For Braverman, the shape of a technological system is subordinate to the manager’s desire to wrest control of the labor process from the workers. Technological change is construed as the outcome of negotiations among interested parties who seek to incorporate their own interests into the design and configuration of the machinery. This position represents the new mainstream called social constructivism.<br><br>The constructivists gain acceptance by misrepresenting technological determinism: technological determinists are supposed to believe, for example, that machinery imposes appropriate forms of order on society. The alternative to constructivism, in other words, is to view technology as existing outside society, capable of directly influencing skills and work organization.<br><br>Clark refutes the extremes of the constructivists by both theoretical and empirical arguments. Theoretically he defines \"technology\"  in terms of relationships between social and technical variables. Attempts to reduce the meaning of technology to cold, hard metal are bound to fail, for machinery is just scrap unless it is organized functionally and supported by appropriate systems of operation and maintenance. At the empirical level Clark shows how a change at the telephone exchange from maintenance-intensive electromechanical switches to semielectronic switching systems altered work tasks, skills, training opportunities, administration, and organization of workers.

{"text": "Earth's surface consists of rigid plates that are constantly shifting and jostling one another. Plate movements are the surface expressions of motions in the mantle—the thick shell of rock that lies between Earth's crust and its metallic core. Although the hot rock of the mantle is a solid, under the tremendous pressure of the crust and overlying rock of the mantle, it flows like a viscous liquid.

In particular, top management decision-sharing- consensus-oriented, team-based decision-making - may increase the likelihood that firms will adhere to their plans, because those involved in the decision-making may be more committed to the chosen course of action, thereby increasing the likelihood that organizations will subsequently adhere to their plans.<br><br><span style=\"background-color:#ff0\">However, the relationship between top management decision-sharing and adherence to plans may be affected by a firm's strategic mission (its fundamental approach to increasing sales revenue and market share, and generating cash flow and short-term profits).</span> At one end of the strategic mission continuum, \"build\" strategies are pursued when a firm desires to increase its market share and is willing to sacrifice short-term profits to do so. At the other end, \"harvest\" strategies are used when a firm is willing to sacrifice market share for short-term profitability and cash-flow maximization. Research and theory suggest that top management decision-sharing may have a more positive relationship with adherence to plans among firms with harvest strategies than among firms with build strategies. In a study of strategic practices in several large firms, managers in harvest strategy scenarios were more able to adhere to their business plans. As one of the managers in the study explained it, this is partly because \"<i>typically all a manager has to do when implementing a harvest strategy is that which was done last year.</i>\" Additionally, managers under harvest strategies mayhave fewer strategic options than do those under build strategies; it may therefore be easier to reach agreement on a particular course of action through decision-sharing, which will in turn tend to promote adherence to plans. Conversely, in a \"build\" strategy scenario, individual leadership, rather than decision-sharing, may promote adherence to plans. Build strategies - which typically require leaders with strong personal visions for a firm's future, rather than the negotiated compromise of the team-based decision - may be most closely adhered to when implemented in the context of a clear strategic vision of an individual leader, rather than through the practice of decision-sharing.", "choice_question": "Which of the following best describes the function of the first sentence of the second paragraph of the passage?", "subid": 1, "qid": "1a7smk", "answer": "D", "options": [["A", "To answer a question posed in the first sentence of the passage about why firms adopt particular strategic missions"], ["B", "To refute an argument made in the first paragraph about how top management decision-making affects whether firms will adhere to their strategic plans"], ["C", "To provide evidence supporting a theory introduced in the first paragraph about what makes firms adhere to or deviate from their strategic plants"], ["D", "To qualify an assertion made in the preceding sentence (lines 6-16) about how top management decision-making affects the likelihood that firms will adhere to their strategic plans"], ["E", "To explain a distinction relied on in the second paragraph (lines 17-68) regarding two different kinds of strategic missions"]], "enid": "021kok"}
