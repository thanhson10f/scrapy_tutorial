<div class="question">1. A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally command a high price. Because <b>technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed</b> and companies want to make large profits while they still can, many companies charge the greatest price the market will bear when they have such a product. But <b>large profits on the new product will give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match the new product's capabilities</b>. Consequently, the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest possible price.<br><br>In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?<ul><li style="list-style: none">A - The first is an assumption that forms the basis for a course of action that the argument criticizes; the second presents the course of action endorsed by the argument.</li><li style="list-style: none">B - The first is a consideration raised to explain the appeal of a certain strategy; the second is a consideration raised to call into question the wisdom of adopting that strategy.</li><li style="list-style: none">C - The first is an assumption that has been used to justify a certain strategy; the second is a consideration that is used to cast doubt on that assumption.</li><li style="list-style: none">D - The first is a consideration raised in support of a strategy the argument endorses; the second presents grounds in support of that consideration.</li><li style="list-style: none">E - The first is a consideration raised to show that adopting a certain strategy is unlikely to achieve the intended effect; the second is presented to explain the appeal of that strategy.</li></ul></div><div class="question">2.

Thus, some environmentalists conclude that <b>Tropicorp has not acted wholly out of economic self-interest</b>. However, these environmentalists are probably wrong. The initial investment required for a successful rubber-tapping operation is larger than that needed for a cattle ranch. Furthermore, there is a shortage of workers employable in rubber-tapping operations, and finally, taxes are higher on profits from rubber tapping than on profits from cattle ranching.<br><br>In the economist's argument, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?<ul><li style="list-style: none">A - The first supports the conclusion of the economist's argument; the second calls that conclusion into question.</li><li style="list-style: none">B - The first states the conclusion of the economist's argument; the second supports that conclusion.</li><li style="list-style: none">C - The first supports the environmentalists' conclusion; the second states that conclusion.</li><li style="list-style: none">D - The first states the environmentalists' conclusion; the second states the conclusion of the economist's argument.</li><li style="list-style: none">E - Each supports the conclusion of the economist's argument.</li></ul></div><div class="question">16.

Historian: In the Drindian Empire, censuses were conducted annually to determine the population of each village. <b>Village census records for the last half of the 1600's are remarkably complete</b>. This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five years immediately followed an increase in a certain Drindian tax. This tax, which was assessed on villages, was computed by the central government using the annual census figures. Obviously, whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive to minimize the number of people they recorded; and concealing the size of a village's population from government census takers would have been easy.

Sunflowers growing in pots were placed, with their roots submerged, in the pond contaminated with radioactive elements. The sunflowers kept growing; in the process, they absorbed radioactive elements.
